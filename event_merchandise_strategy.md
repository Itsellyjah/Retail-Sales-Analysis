## Key Strategic Insights

### 1. Product Selection Strategy: Focus on High-Margin Technology and Office Supplies

Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of product profitability:

- **Technology products** generate the highest profit margin (17.4%) with Copiers (37.2%), Accessories (25.1%), and Phones (13.5%) being standout performers

- **Furniture** underperforms with a mere 2.5% profit margin, with Tables and Bookcases consistently generating negative profits

**Recommendation:** Stock your event merchandise with a primary focus on Technology accessories and high-margin Office Supplies. Limit Furniture offerings to only the most profitable items (Chairs) and avoid Tables and Bookcases entirely.

### 2. Regional Targeting: Prioritize West and East Regions

Regional analysis shows significant profitability variations:

- **West Region** delivers the highest profit per customer ($158) and profit per order ($67)
- **East Region** follows closely with strong profit metrics ($136 per customer)
- **Central Region** significantly underperforms with just $63 profit per customer

**Recommendation:** Schedule more frequent and larger events in West and East coast cities, particularly in California, New York, and Washington. Limit Central region events or adjust product mix to focus exclusively on highest-margin items.

### 3. Seasonal Timing: Capitalize on Q4 and Strategic Monthly Peaks

Time-based analysis reveals clear seasonal patterns:

- **Peak sales months** are November, December, and September
- **Q4 (Oct-Dec)** consistently outperforms all other quarters
- **Year-over-year growth** shows consistent increases from 2015-2017, with 2017 showing 28.3% order growth

**Recommendation:** Schedule your most important events during Q4, particularly in November and December to capitalize on holiday shopping. Secondary events should target September for back-to-school shopping. Consider smaller "pop-up" events during traditionally slower months (January, February) with highly targeted merchandise.

### 4. Customer Targeting: Tailor Offerings to Segment Preferences

Customer segmentation analysis reveals distinct purchasing behaviors:

- **Corporate customers** place larger orders with higher average values
- **Consumer segment** responds best to technology products
- **Home Office** customers show strong preference for office supplies

**Recommendation:** Create segment-specific event merchandise packages. For corporate events, focus on bulk office supplies and technology bundles. For consumer-facing events, emphasize the latest technology products, especially Phones and Accessories.

### 5. Product Bundling: Leverage Natural Purchase Patterns

Order analysis reveals strong co-purchase patterns:

- **Binders + Paper** is the most common product pair (275 orders)
- **Binders + Phones** and **Binders + Storage** also show strong affinity
- **Office Essentials** bundle (Binders + Paper + Storage) has high potential for corporate customers

![Product Bundling](/Users/ellyjahsoraya/Downloads/Retail Sales/analysis/order_inventory_insights/product_bundling.png)

**Recommendation:** Create pre-packaged bundles based on these natural purchase patterns. Offer bundle discounts instead of individual product discounts to maintain profitability while driving higher average order values.

### 6. Discount Strategy: Implement a Disciplined Approach

Discount impact analysis reveals critical profitability thresholds:

- **High discounts (>40%)** significantly reduce profit margins and often lead to negative profits
- **26.3% of all orders** have negative profit, largely due to excessive discounting
- **Zero discount items** have the highest overall profit margin

![Discount Impact](/Users/ellyjahsoraya/Downloads/Retail Sales/analysis/profitability_analysis/discount_impact_analysis.png)

**Recommendation:** Implement a strict discount ceiling of 20% for individual products. Instead of deep discounts, offer value through bundling, loyalty programs, or event-exclusive products. Reserve higher discounts (30-40%) only for bulk purchases by corporate customers.

## Event Merchandise Calendar: A Year-Round Strategy

Based on our comprehensive analysis, here's an optimized event merchandise calendar:

### Q1 (Jan-Mar): Technology Refresh Events
- **Focus:** Latest Technology products, especially Accessories and Phones
- **Regions:** Primarily West Coast cities
